# Unsemantic CSS Framework

## Introduction

This is a fluid grid system for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### Edit from @runbiscuit:
_However, instead of having the standard grid, you have **100 columns**._
There's not many situations where you really need 100 columns, but for whatever reason, this was a fork I did back in 2018.
I'm not fixing what's not broken, so I shall keep this as is, for many years to come.

### Warning
Usage of this library will cause much higher bandwidth usage than usual. Expect clutter in the Styles pane when using Inspect Element.
Use Sass to make it a little more efficient, I guess.

## Modification Outcome

These classes will be available in this library:

| Type                   | Start                    | End                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Prefix                 | `prefix-1`               | `prefix-100`        |
| Suffix                 | `suffix-1`               | `suffix-100`        |
| Grid                   | `grid-1`                 | `grid-100`          |
| Prefix (tablet)        | `tablet-prefix-1`        | `tablet-prefix-100` |
| Suffix (tablet)        | `tablet-suffix-1`        | `tablet-suffix-100` |
